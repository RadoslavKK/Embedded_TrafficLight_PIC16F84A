## 📌 Features

- 🚦 Controls a **basic traffic light system** (red, yellow, and green LEDs).
- ⏳ Implements **timing delays** using the internal clock.
- 🔄 Cyclic operation based on real-world traffic light behavior.
- 🛠️ Code written in **Assembly (ASM)** for optimal performance.
- 🏗️ Designed for **PIC16F84A**, but adaptable to similar PIC microcontrollers.
